    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>To make cupcakes, first preheat the oven to 325Â°F. Then, place paper baking cups into a muffin pan. Afterwards, get a large bowl and mix flour, granulated sugar and salt using a whisk. Set that aside and get a saucepan (one-quart sized). Heat one cup of butter, water, and three tablespoons of baking cocoa to boiling. Remove the saucepan from the heat and pour it into the flour mixture before mixing them altogether. Add buttermilk, baking soda, vanilla, and eggs before mixing well. Then divide the batter evenly among the muffin cups (fill them two-thirds full). Put them in the oven and bake for 20 to 25 minutes.</p>
    <p>To make the frosting, get a saucepan (one-quart sized) and heat butter, baking cocoa and milk to simmering. Afterwards, remove the saucepan from the heat and add in powdered sugar before beating. Spoon the warm icing over the cupcakes (after finished baking and cooling down).</p>
